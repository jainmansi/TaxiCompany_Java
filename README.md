## Problem Statement

I am designing an object model for the Taxi Company which owns 3 kinds of vehicles:

1. Van (7 Seater)
2. Car (4 Seater)
3. Motorcycle (2 Seater)

Customers always visit this taxi company in groups of 2, 4 or 7.

All the customers request vehicles at random times between 5 - 10 minutes in whole minutes increment.

All customers take a ride for random times between 10 - 20 minutes in whole minute increments.

**Assumptions**

1. All rides start and end at same location

2. Customers are riding in circular track which takes 1 minute for each loop

3. Customers of group size 2 always take Motorcycle, group size 4 always take Car and group size 7 always take the Van.
